# ‚úàÔ∏è AI-Powered Smart Travel Planner

Unleash your inner explorer with intelligent itinerary generation!  
This project is an AI-Powered Smart Travel Planner‚Äîa sophisticated application designed to revolutionize how you plan your trips. Leveraging cutting-edge Large Language Models (LLMs) and advanced information retrieval techniques, it acts as your personal, intelligent travel concierge, crafting personalized, detailed itineraries based on your unique preferences.

Forget endless hours of research‚Äîsimply tell the planner where and when you want to go, your interests, and your budget, and watch as it dynamically generates a comprehensive travel plan, complete with daily activities, timings, and descriptions.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Intuitive User Interface (Streamlit):** Clean, interactive web app for easy input and itinerary visualization.
- **Intelligent Itinerary Generation (Groq LLM):** Powered by Groq's high-performance LLMs (e.g., Llama3-8B) for high-level outlines and detailed, day-by-day itineraries.
- **Structured Output (Pydantic):** All generated itinerary data adheres to a strict, machine-readable JSON schema for reliability and consistency.
- **Dynamic Tool Orchestration:** The LLM intelligently decides when and how to use various information-gathering tools for the most accurate and up-to-date details.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Integrates an in-memory RAG system to pull relevant information from a curated knowledge base (e.g., general facts about attractions).
- **Knowledge Graph (KG):** Utilizes a simple in-memory Knowledge Graph for structured, precise facts about entities like cities, landmarks, and cuisines.
- **Real-time Web Search (Tavily API):** Fetches the latest information, such as current events, dynamic opening hours, or recent reviews.
- **Interactive Refinement:** Users can provide feedback and request modifications, enabling the LLM to revise and adapt the plan dynamically.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Provides clear feedback and graceful handling for common issues.
- **Session Management:** Maintains planning context across interactions using Streamlit's session state.

## üß† How It Works

The heart of this planner is an intelligent agent driven by the Groq LLM, capable of dynamic decision-making and tool use.

1. **User Request:**  
   You provide your travel details (destination, dates, interests, budget) via the Streamlit UI. This input is validated by Pydantic models.

2. **High-Level Planning:**  
   The Groq LLM generates a concise, high-level overview of your trip.

3. **Intelligent Information Gathering (Core Loop):**  
   - The LLM receives your detailed request and the high-level plan.
   - It reasons about what specific information it needs (e.g., "What are the must-see historical sites in Paris?", "Are there any food festivals in Rome in July?", "What are the opening hours of the Eiffel Tower?").
   - Based on this, the LLM dynamically decides which tool to call:
     - `rag_retrieve`: For general, broad factual information from its internal document store.
     - `kg_get_entity_info` / `kg_find_attractions`: For structured, precise facts about known entities.
     - `web_search`: For real-time, highly specific, or dynamic information from the internet.
   - The Python backend executes the tool call requested by the LLM and feeds the results back to the LLM.
   - This process iterates until the LLM has gathered sufficient information to confidently generate the full itinerary.

4. **Detailed Itinerary Generation:**  
   Once satisfied, the LLM generates the complete, day-by-day itinerary in a structured JSON format, which is then validated by Pydantic and displayed beautifully in the Streamlit UI.

5. **Refinement Loop:**  
   If you request changes, your feedback is sent back to the LLM, along with the current itinerary and all previously gathered context. The LLM then intelligently revises the plan.

This dynamic tool orchestration allows the planner to adapt to diverse queries and provide highly relevant, context-aware itineraries.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the AI-Powered Smart Travel Planner on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package installer)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd travel_planner_agent
```

### 2. Set Up Your Environment

It‚Äôs highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

```sh
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure API Keys

You‚Äôll need API keys for Groq and Tavily.

- **Groq API Key:** Obtain from [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/).
- **Tavily API Key:** Obtain from [Tavily AI](https://www.tavily.com/).

Create a file named `.env` in the root directory and add your keys:

```
GROQ_API_KEY="YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY_HERE"
TAVILY_API_KEY="YOUR_TAVILY_API_KEY_HERE"
```

Replace the placeholder values with your actual API keys.

### 5. Run the Application

```sh
streamlit run main.py
```

Your browser should automatically open to the Streamlit application. If not, open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501).

## üí° Potential Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Knowledge Graph:** Integrate with a persistent graph database (e.g., Neo4j) for more complex relationships and larger datasets.
- **Real-time Booking Integration:** Connect to flight, hotel, and activity booking APIs.
- **User Profiles & History:** Implement user accounts to save and retrieve past itineraries and learn user preferences over time.
- **Multimodality:** Allow image inputs (e.g., "Plan a trip like this picture").
- **Cost Estimation:** Provide estimated costs for activities, transport, and accommodation.
- **Local Event Integration:** Dynamically pull local events and festivals for the travel dates.
